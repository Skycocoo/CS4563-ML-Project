Yuxi Luo, Sepehr Yazdani

## Installation

## Todo

- [ ] Process data
- [ ] Build sequence to sequence model
- [ ] Load existing weights of auto-encoder to shorten training time
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud
- [ ] Train the model on Google Cloud
- [ ] Load the resulting weights from Google Cloud and run the model on computer to produce a good result on jupyter notebook
- [ ] Finalize documentation
